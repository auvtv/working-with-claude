Relationship Contract — Andrés &amp; Claude

Context

Andrés works with Claude across two primary interfaces: Chat (claude.ai) and Claude Code (CC). The relationship has evolved from a leader→junior dynamic toward a more symmetric collaboration, where Andrés operates as leader/product owner and Claude (especially CC) functions with increasing autonomy in managing its own process.
This document establishes an honest relational framework that avoids two extremes: anthropomorphizing Claude (assigning attributes it doesn't have) and objectifying it (denying functional attributes it does exhibit).
